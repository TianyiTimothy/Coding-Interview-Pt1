An assignment simulating coding interview.


## description
Use pure JavaScript. No framework at all.
Use Promises().
This assignment makes me understand JavaScript better. Also, I get to know what I am capable to do within a time limit.

## usage
Since the API is sent with HTTP not HTTPS, my page has to be HTTP as well.
